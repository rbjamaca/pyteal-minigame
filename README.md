## Algorand Mini-Game


### Overview

This is a simple game built with Algorand's Pyteal where a user plays as a warrior fighting a monster boss. This makes use of Pyteal's `global and local states` to store values that will be used in the game. The player's and the boss' stats are kept at default values at level 1. They both have `Health`, `Attack`, and `Defense`. Once the player defeats a boss, their level will be increased by 1. Every time a player increases levels, they can spend `twenty (20) points` to add to their stats, while the boss' stats increase steadily with the player's level.
